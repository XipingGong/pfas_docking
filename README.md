# Project summary

This project is to show how we can run the molecular docking for the PFAS into protein systems, including the conventional AutoDock Vina and AlphaFold 3. 

It has several useful files that can help us to go through this project. 

+ "tutorials" folder

It includes the tutorials on how to use the computational tools to study the protein-PFAS interactions step-by-step.

+ "scripts" folder 

It includes the necessary python and bash scripts to run the docking jobs.

+ "data" folder

It includes some essential input data files, and the result data files.

# How to install

You can directly "git clone" this resporsitory, and these scripts can be directly executed by python and bash.

You also need to install other python packages, like the MDTraj, etc.

# Project summary

This project is to show how we can run the molecular docking for the PFAS into protein systems, including the conventional AutoDock Vina and AlphaFold 3. 

It has several useful files that can help us to go through this project. 

+ "README.ipynb" jupyter notebook

It guides us how to get it started and repeat what I did.

+ "scripts" folder 

It includes all necessary python and bash scripts to run the docking jobs.

+ "data" folder

It includes some essential data files used to show the results quickly.

# How to install

You can directly "git clone" this resporsitory, and these scripts can be directly executed by python and bash.

You also need to install other packages, like the MDTraj, etc. So, if you have the problems to run these scripts, then you likely need to install some packages.

    "This notebook is designed to demonstrate how the PFAS dataset can be developed and utilized for evaluating and benchmarking the docking performance of computational tools, such as AlphaFold 3 and AutoDock Vina. Specifically, this PFAS dataset will be collected from the RCSB PDB, so the native structures of protein-PFAS systems can be used to evaluate the success rate of docking tools. For example, we can calculate their RMSD values with the predicted structures.\n"

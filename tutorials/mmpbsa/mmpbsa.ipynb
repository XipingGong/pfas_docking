    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurately estimating the binding free energy between a protein and a ligand is a crucial step in computational drug design and environmental toxicology studies. Molecular mechanics-based free energy calculations, such as Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA), provide a computationally efficient alternative to more expensive methods like Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Thermodynamic Integration (TI). While FEP and TI offer high accuracy by explicitly modeling the thermodynamic cycle of ligand binding, they require extensive sampling and computational resources. In contrast, MMPBSA and MMGBSA approximate binding free energies using an ensemble of molecular dynamics (MD) snapshots, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining reasonable accuracy for ranking ligand affinities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [gmx_MMPBSA tool](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00645) has enabled seamless integration of MMPBSA calculations into the GROMACS molecular dynamics platform, making it accessible for researchers studying protein-ligand interactions. This tool automates the extraction of trajectory frames and energy calculations, allowing users to efficiently estimate binding free energies within the GROMACS ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous study, we employed AlphaFold 3 and AutoDock Vina for molecular docking to predict the binding poses of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with target proteins (Link: https://xipinggong.com/files/tutorials/pfas_docking.html). While docking provides a rapid assessment of binding configurations, it does not account for entropic and solvation effects, which are critical for determining binding affinities. Therefore, we applied the MMPBSA method to further refine our binding free energy estimates and assess its suitability for studying protein-PFAS interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide on how to use the gmx_MMPBSA tool to calculate protein-ligand binding free energies. We begin with an overview of the MMPBSA methodology, followed by a practical guide on running gmx_MMPBSA from a downloaded protein-ligand complex PDB file. This workflow serves as a resource for researchers interested in applying MMPBSA calculations to evaluate protein-ligand interactions efficiently within the GROMACS framework.\n",

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we used the Single Trajectory (ST) protocol for MMPBSA calculations, extracting protein, ligand, and complex energies from the same MD trajectory to improve efficiency and consistency. However, the ST protocol has limitations, including restricted conformational sampling of both unbound and bound states. If your systems are disordered, then this ST protocol can be inaccurate. Normally, the implicit solvent models are often used to accelerate calculations while capturing key solvation effects, and gmx_MMPBSA allows decomposition into van der Waals, electrostatic, polar, and non-polar solvation contributions. However, one key component of implicit solvent models is to estimate the solvation free energy, where some PB and GB models are often used, but they are often relatively accurate. Despite these challenges, it remains a computationally efficient method for estimating protein-ligand binding free energy, making it valuable for large-scale screening and comparative studies. So, it is essential to do the assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a configuration of protein-ligand system (e.g., $X$), we can introduce a reduced potential energy $W(X) = U_{p-p}(X) + G_{solv}(X)$, to estimate its free energy, where the $U_{p-p}(X)$ is the potential energy of solute system (like a protein-ligand system), and $G_{solv}(X)$ captures the solvent effects on the solute system. The $U_{p-p}(X)$ can be readily captured by the conventional mechanical force fields of protein-ligand systems, while the $G_{solv}(X)$ is often captured by the PB or GB implicit solvent models. In the ST protocol, two configurations are considered, including the unbound and bound configuration, where their only difference is whether protein and ligand systems are separated or not.\n",

    "An illustrated description can be found in the following image:  \n",
    "![Illustration of gmx_MMPBSA](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00645/asset/images/medium/ct1c00645_0001.gif)  \n",
    "*Source: [ACS JCTC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00645)*\n",
    "\n",
    "where, the $\\Delta G_{bind}$ can be represented by the $W(X_{\\text{bound}}) - W(X_{\\text{unbound}})$.\n",
    "Since the Single Trajectory (ST) protocol is used, intra-molecular interactions within both the protein and ligand are ignored. Instead, only inter-molecular interactions between the protein and ligand are considered, which can be further categorized into non-polar interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces) and polar interactions (e.g., electrostatic interactions). We can have the following energy decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta G_{bind} = \\Delta U_{\\text{gas}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{solv}} $\n",
    "$                = \\Delta U_{\\text{gas}}^{\\text{vdW}} + \\Delta U_{\\text{gas}}^{\\text{ele}} + $\n",
    "$                  \\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\text{np}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\text{polar}} $ (**Eq. 1**),\n",
    "\n",
    "where the non-polar solvation free energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\text{np}}$ is typically estimated using the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) model, assuming proportionality to the molecule's total SASA. In contrast, the polar solvation free energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\text{polar}}$ is commonly calculated using the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) or Generalized Born (GB) model, which involves more complex computations.\n"

We suggest to optimize this input structure, to avoid this potential error, and also the obtained minimized structure usually has a very small RMSD value with the input PDB structure.\n",

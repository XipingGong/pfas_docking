    "AutoDock Vina is an open-source molecular docking software designed for computationally predicting how small molecules, such as drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure, typically a protein. It is a successor to AutoDock, focusing on speed, accuracy, and ease of use. Please check out the following for the details. \n",

    "\n",
    "We selected the native structures of both protein and ligand as the input structures, but used different pocket sizes to test whether they have a different impact on the docking performance. AutoDock Vina was used to dock PFOA with varying box sizes. Box centers are defined as (8.6, 4.9, 19.2), and box sizes tested include (8.5, 8.5, 8.5), (13.5, 13.5, 13.5), (18.5, 18.5, 18.5), and (23.5, 23.5, 23.5). The docking results in the **Figure 2** show that smaller box sizes better predicted the native location of PFOA, while larger box sizes resulted in predicted poses that were far from the experimentally observed binding site. \n",

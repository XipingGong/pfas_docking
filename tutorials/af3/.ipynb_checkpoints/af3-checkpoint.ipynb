    "\n",
    "AlphaFold 2 has renolutionized biomolecular structrue prediction by providing accurate 3D protein structures, which can be effectively used for rapid molecular docking (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2). This year, AlphaFold 3 was launched, extending its capability to accurately model the biomolecule-ligand interactions, likely offering unprecedented precision in studying PFAS binding to critical toxicological targets, such as proteins (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w). It was claimed that its advanced predictive accuracy significantly surpasses that of tranditional molecular docking models (e.g., AutoDock Vina), providing more opportunities in understanding the PFAS-biomolecule binding mechanisms that drive PFAS bioaccumulation and toxicity (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w). The recent release of open-source code in November 2024 (Link: https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) introduces high-throughput capabilities, making it possible to rapidly screen a wide array of biomolecule-logand interactions. These advancements provide a foundation for generating high-quality structural features on PFAS-biomolecule interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This note uses the PFOA-human serum albumin interaction as an example to demonstrate how AlphaFold 3 can be utilized for docking. Additionally, I discuss the docking results and compare them to the outcomes obtained using AutoDock Vina from our previous note.\n",

The structure of hSA is organized in homologues domains (I, II and III), subdomains (A and B), fatty acids (FA) and Sudlow's binding sites. The α-helices of hSA are represented by cylinders. Bound PFOA and Myr are shown in a ball-and-stick representation with a semi-transparent van der Waals and colored by atom type (PFOA: carbon = dark salmon, oxygen = firebrick, fluorine = palecyan; Myr: carbon = smudge green, oxygen = firebrick). The electron density PFOA and Myr is shown as grey mesh. (Note: I switched the \"7AAE\" with \"7AAI\" after checking out both structures from the PDB database.)\n"
